This shell example works 2 ways, interactive mode and a batch file mode.
Interactive is just like a shell, it will execute commands and it will do them sequentially if '|' is between them or concurrently if ';' is between. If quit is written in a chunk with these characters all commands will be done before quiting.
The batch mode takes a file and reads it until it sees "quit". It also executes commands the same with interactive.

Its structure is like this:

Main determines the mode of the program and calls its method.

These methods have loops that are simulating the shell.

Ofcourse there are supporting methods like, split (splitting the code by '|'), exc (checking the ';' characters and executing the code in a threaded fashion according to the ';'s.

I used pthread library for concurrency.

********************

I handle quiting after all commands finish by checking for quits as command tokens and do not execute it but rather return 0 and exit the code after the function is finished.

******************

the last command that is entered is sometimes not executed correctly I assume this is the only problem but despite my efforts of changing the code uncountable times I always kept having errors. This is probably because my lack of knowledge in c language.
